Hi there ðŸ‘‹! I'm a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics with a minor Korean Studies at the University of Maryland. I am fortunate to be advised by [Professor Rachel Rudinger](https://rudinger.github.io/). 

I'm a member of the [Computational Linguistics and Information Processing (CLIP)](https://wiki.umiacs.umd.edu/clip/index.php/Main_Page) lab in [UMIACS](https://www.umiacs.umd.edu/).

My research interests lie in natural language processing, particularly in commonsense reasoning in LLMs and problems of bias and fairness in NLP.

I am currently working under Professor Kenny Zhu and Sinong Wang at the [Arlington Computational Linguistics Lab (ACL^2)](https://acl-group.github.io/) at the University of Texas at Arlington identifying structural similarities to human language and contextual semantics within animal vocalizations to gain insights about the language of animal species. This work is graciously supported by the [NSF](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/). I previously worked under Professor Michael Littman at the [Reinforcement Learning & Adaptive Behavior (RLAB)](http://bigai.cs.brown.edu/) group at Brown University on applications of reinforcement learning to 2D non-sequential tasks. We published our findings at [AAAI-22 IMLW](https://sites.google.com/view/aaai22-imlw) and [RLDM-22](https://rldm.org/).
